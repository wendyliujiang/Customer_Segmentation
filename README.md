# Customer_Segmentation

# Introduction
Improving Business to Business sales Using Machine Learning Algorithms 


A carpets manufacturer is looking to leverage the power of customer segmentation to increase the sample conversion rate, thereby augmenting overall revenue. The process involves grouping customers based on certain characteristics, which can include demographics, psychographics, buying behavior, or other factors.

With effective customer segmentation, the manufacturer can identify and understand the specific needs and preferences of each group. They can then use this understanding to tailor their marketing strategies, products, and services to match the desires of these specific customer groups.

For instance, a segment may consist of customers who are likely to buy high-end, luxury carpets. Marketing strategies aimed at this group would emphasize quality and exclusivity, potentially offering a more personalized service or tailored product options. On the other hand, another segment might consist of budget-conscious customers, where the focus would be on affordability and value for money.

By accurately addressing the needs of each segment, the manufacturer can significantly improve their sample conversion rate. Not only will this create a more satisfying customer experience, but it can also lead to increased sales and, consequently, higher revenue.

Moreover, the insights derived from customer segmentation can help the manufacturer in product development, operations, and even in strategic decisions, all of which contribute to the company's growth and profitability in the long term.


# Steps 

 - Use various visuals to explore the Sales data.
 - Segment Champoâ€™s customers using Customer data (Do not use Sales data to segment, as some customers have bought multiple times and hence multiple entries in the sales data may correspond to the same customer). You should try different methods and your points will be based on your characterization of clusters and not just for clustering.
-  What other Machine Learning tools can Champo employ here? (Just name the tools and their use. You do not have to do the analysis)
-  What will be your final recommendation(s) for the company?
